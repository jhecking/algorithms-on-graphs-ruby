  # Walks all vertices reachable from a given seed vertex or set of seed
  # vertices in either depth-first or breadth-first order. The method takes a
  # number of procs that trigger during certain phases of the walk:
  #
  # - previsit:  Called whenever a new vertex is first discovered as the
  #              adjacent vertex of the currently visited vertex. The proc will
  #              be called with the vertex v as the first parameter. previsit
  #              is also called before a seed vertex is visited; in the latter
  #              case the proc will receive a second paramter with the value
  #              true to indicate that the vertex v is a seed vertex.
  # - visit:     Called whenever a vertex is being visited; the proc will be
  #              called with the vertex v as the first and only paramter.
  # - postvisit: Called for vertex v once v as well as all vertices that were
  #              discovered as part of the exploration of v have been visited.
